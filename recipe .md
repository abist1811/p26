To cook stuffed aloo (potato) paratha:
Firstly we will prepare the wheat dough by using the wheat flour and mixing it with water.
We need a soft dough fot it and greese it with oil and keep aside.
To prepare te potato filling we will boil the potatoes. cool and peel them.
Now we will mash the boiled potatoes and add all the dry spices salt as per taste, red paprika, turmeric and corriander powder to it as per taste.
Mix this mixture properly so as the potatoes are completly coated in spices.
Here we can now add freshly cut corriander leaves to the mixture.
Take a small ball of the dough roll it into a small circle. put a small amount of the filing in it seal it and make ball again. now roll it into thick parathas
Heat a pan and place the paratha on it. when half cooked flip it to the other side.
Greese this side with ghee or oil. flip it again and repeat the greasing of that side too.
Cook it for some time till it becomes golden brown
